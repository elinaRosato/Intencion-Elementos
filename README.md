<!-- PROJECT REQUIREMENTS -->
## Project Requirements
As I said before, this is the final version of a proyect I have been working on during my first course on Web Development from Coderhouse.
The task was to develop a responsive website with 5 sections in different HTML files. It should contain real content, images, hyperlinks, good structure, handling of grids, use of the framework, SEO basics and animation.
According to Coderhouse, the final project must meet the following requirements:
* Web Structure: The Website is structured based on the chosen framework: Bootstrap, making use of utility classes to build grids, web elements and styles of the framework, in addition to the HTML content. All pages have structured content and linked style. In case of choosing a framework, you also have to have added the different Javascript and CSS libraries pertinent to the framework.
* Web Style: The student must create SCSS or SASS files to style their website, making correct use of nesting, mixins, variables and SASS language operators.
* Implementation of Node modules: include package.json and package-lock.json files and, in case of using another npm module, add it as a dependency to the project.
* Upload to server: The student must use any hosting service to put their website online.
* Github repository: The student must use git correctly to version their project and use Github to provide access to the versioned project.



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

My friend started running a small business last year during quarantine. She started recycling glass bottles turning them into glasses or soy candles, and commercializing them through the proyect intagram account: https://www.instagram.com/intencion.elementos/?hl=en
She continued growing her business and her community started asking for advices, more sustainable products and even articles about mindfulness and other topics she shared in her instagram stories.
So I decided to create a complete website for her, where she could:

* Upload her products, includding product description, product price and the "add tho chart" button.
* Post blogs about mindfullness, sustentability, productivity, and anything else she felt like writing about.
* Include an "about me" section where she could make a brief presentation of herself and her life story.
* Give to her community the possibility to join a newsletter to have access to exclusive content.
* Include links to her social media pages.

<!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
## What I learned

I think it will be impossible to list everything I learned but I'll give it a try:

* Website design: draw a sketch, choose color palettes, choose fonts, create a mockup and a prototype.
* HTML: Semantic elements, tags, attributes, best practices (indentation, file naming conventions and directory structurelists), forms, tables, links and multimedia.
* CSS: Order of importance, class vs. id, selectors, typography, positioning and floats, color (hexadecimal, rgb and named), measures, box model, flexbox, grids, transformations and animations, SASS and SCSS.
* Frameworks: Bootstrap, Bootstrap Themes, responsive design, libraries, media queries.
* Apply SEO to my website: good usage of headings, meta tags on HTML head.
* Git: version control sistems, terminal comands, status, create version commits, merge branches.
* Git Hub: create repository, upload changes with git pull, README.md and .gitignore files.
* Upload website to a server.
* Create a budget for the project. 



<!-- PROJECT DEVOLUTION -->
## Project devolution

The project obtained the calification 10/10 and this are some of the devolutions I recieved:

* "Congratulations for your excellent work. On a technical level it meets all expectations, impeccable code, good use of semantic labels, it adapts correctly to different resolutions and the design is gorgeous. I have no more words, just congrats!" from Laura Avalle, teacher of Coderhouse.

* "You perfectly applied everything you learned during the classes. I have no more to comment than to congratulate you. You did a phenomenal job. The site is amazing both aesthetically and functionally, very well designed and programmed. The footer you created is the best I have seen since I was a tutor. I applaud the work and effort you invested. Very good work!" from Franco Ezequiel, my tutor during the course.
